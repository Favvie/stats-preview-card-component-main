### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I learn how to properly center a div using the absolute positioning method. I was also able to implement my knowledge of CSS grid. 

For the code snippet, see below:

```css
.wrapper {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

This project exposed areas that I have completely mastered such as  the CSS grid, adding overlays among others.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://styled-components.com/docs) - I just discovered this and I didn't actually use it but it has interesting concepts.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njdJeu95p6s) - This youtube video that taught me how to center a div vertically and horizontally. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
